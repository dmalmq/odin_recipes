    <h3>What makes the recipe so good</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>It’s perfectly crispy and totally delicious!</strong> We use a
      secret ingredient to yield the crispiest pan-fried schnitzel of all time.

      It’s surprisingly easy to make! Simply coat the steaks in flour, whisked
      eggs, then breadcrumbs before cooking for a few minutes per side. In three
      very simple steps and

      traditional recipes use.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5 thin-cut steaks</li>
      <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>freshly cracked black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together the all purpose flour, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and
        black pepper in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dredge each steak in the flour mixture to coat, then dip in whisked
        eggs, then dip and coat in panko breadcrumbs. Repeat this dipping
        process for all steaks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once oil is
        hot, add in steaks in an even layer and cook about 4 minutes per side or
        until golden brown. Repeat until all steaks are cooked, adding more oil
        to skillet as needed. Serve immediately.
