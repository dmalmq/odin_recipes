    <h3>Key Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Shrimp</strong> – Pick up a pound of raw, peeled, and deveined
      shrimp for this recipe. You can either leave the tail on or off your
      shrimp. I prefer keeping the tail on as I think it helps trap just a bit
      more flavor. Though for easier/neater eating, simply remove each tail
      before cooking!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cajun Seasoning</strong> – Cajun seasoning coats these shrimp in
      intense flavor. The blend of paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and a
      variety of other spices take this recipe to the next level. However if you
      don’t have Cajun seasoning, you can instead use a mix of paprika, salt,
      and black pepper in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hot Sauce</strong> – Any hot sauce will work here, though I
      recommend Frank’s RedHot. It’s spicy without overpowering the other
      flavors in this recipe. It’s also not too thin and does a perfect job at
      coating and sticking to the shrimp.

      This buffalo shrimp is insanely flavorful and requires just a handful of
      simple ingredients! Shrimp are cooked until tender, then tossed in a spicy
      sauce with just a touch of sweetness. Enjoy this easy buffalo shrimp on
      its own as a tasty appetizer or over a salad for a delicious meal!
