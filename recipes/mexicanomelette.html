      <li>¼ cup milk of choice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons chopped yellow onion</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped bell pepper</li>
      <li>half of one Roma tomato</li>
      <li>¼ cup shredded Mexican cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Crack eggs directly into medium bowl. Add milk of choice, then whisk
        ingredients together vigorously until mixture is pale and foamy, with no
        streaks of yolks or egg whites remaining. Set egg mixture aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat medium skillet over medium heat. When pan is hot, add olive oil and
        swirl pan to coat. Heat skillet until oil is hot and shimmery, then add
        onion, bell pepper, and tomato. Sauté 3 minutes or until vegetables are
        tender, then transfer vegetables to small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully and quickly wipe skillet out with paper towels. Add more oil
        if needed, then pour egg mixture into center of hot skillet. Use spatula
        to spread egg mixture out to edges of skillet, then cook eggs,
        undisturbed, until almost fully set, approximately 2 to 3 minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread sautéed vegetables evenly over top of omelette, then sprinkle
        shredded cheese over. Let omelette cook, undisturbed, 1 to 2 minutes or
        until cheese has melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove skillet from heat. Carefully slide spatula under one edge of
        omelette, then gently fold lifted edge to meet opposite side of
        omelette, folding omelette in half. Slide folded omelette out of skillet
        and onto plate.
